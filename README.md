# Hand-written digit recognition using Logistic Regression

This programming exercise was done as part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course (Stanford University), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

* Built a multi-class logistic regression model to recognize handwritten digits using a dataset of 5000 training examples
*  Implemented One vs all approach and one classifier was trained for each class
* Used Octave's fmincg optimization solver to find the optimal parameters for the model
* Computed training accuracy of the classifier

* Implemented the feedforward propagation algorithm to use weights provided from a trained neural network for prediction and computed the accuracy
